# Natural Language Processing(NLP)

## **1- Natural Language Processing Applications:-**
  * ### Email filters. Email filters are one of the most basic and initial applications of NLP online
  * ### Smart assistants
  * ### Search results
  * ### Predictive text
  * ### Language translation
  * ### Digital phone calls
  * ### Data analysis
  * ### Text analytics

## **2- Common NLP tasks**

  * ###  Text/Document Classification NLP
  * ###  Sentiment Analysis
  * ###  Information Retrieval
  * ###  Part of Speech(POS) Tagging
  * ###  Language Detection and machine translation
  * ###  Conversational Agents
  * ###  knowledge graph
  * ###  Text Summarization
  * ###  Topic Modelling
  * ###  TEXT genration
  * ###  Spell checker and Grammar Correction
  * ###  Text Parsing
  * ###  Speech to Text

## **3- Approaches To NLP**

 * ### A. Heuristic Models
    * ### Regular Expression
    * ### Wordnet
    * ### Open Mind Comman Sence
    
 * ### B. Machine Learning Based Models
    * ### Naive Bayes
    * ### LDA
    * ### Support Vector Machines(SVM)
    * ### Logistic Regression
    * ### Hidden Markov Model
    
 * ### C. Deep Learning Based Models
    * ### RNN
    * ### LSTM
    * ### GRU/CNN
    * ### Transformers
    * ### Autoencoders

## **3- Challlenges in NLP**
 * ### Ambiguty
    Example - I saw the boy on the beach with my binoculars. This could mean that I saw a boy through my binoculars or the boy had my binoculars with him
 * ### Contextual words
    Example - I ran to the store because we ran out of milk.
    Can I run something past you real quick?
    The house is looking really run down.

 * ### Colloquialisms and slang
 
 * ### Synonyms

 * ### Irony and sarcasm

 * ### Errors in text or speech

## NLP Pipeline
  1. ### Data Acquisition
    * You have the dataon your desk
    * Data is availble but not on your desk 
    * Nobody have the data

  2. ### Text preprocession

    * Text cleanup
      * html tags cleaning
      * e-mojis cleaning
      * spelling checking

    * Basic preprocession
      * Tokenization
        * Sentence tokenization
        * Word tokenization
      * Optimal
        * Stop word removel
        * stemming
        * Removing punchuation
        * Lower casing
        * Language detection

    * Advance preprocession
      * part of speech tagging
      * Parsing
      * Co-refrances rsoluation

  3. ### Feature Engineering
    * TF-IDF 
    * Word to vec

  4. ### Modelling
    * Model Building
      * heuristic Approach
      * Machine Learning Approach
      * Deep Learning Approach
      * Cloude API

    * Evaluation
      * Intrinsic Evaluation
      * Extrinsic Evaluation

  5. ### Deployment
    * Deployment
    * Monitoring
    * model Update
